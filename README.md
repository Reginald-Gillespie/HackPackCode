# Hack Pack Code

This repo contains a clone of the virtual filesystem on the [CrunchLabs IDE](https://ide.crunchlabs.com/) under the `./Code` folder. Everything in that folder is a clone of the CrunchLabs code, and does not belong to me.

Libraries that Hack Pack code relies on that cannot be found in the Arduino IDE's library manager can be found under the `./Libraries` folder.
