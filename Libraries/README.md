This folder contains the libraries needed to run Hack Pack that are not in the Arduino IDE's Library Manager.

To install these:
- `.zip` libraries: For each `.zip` library in this repo that you need, download the linked zip file, Then in the Arduino IDE go to `Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .Zip Library`, and open this zip you just downloaded (it will probably be in your Downloads folder).
- Other libraries: For each non-`.zip` library you need in this repo, download the file, then in the Arduino IDE click `Sketch -> Add File`, and select your file from where you saved it.

If you couldn't find a library in the Library Manager, but it's not here, try the following:
1. Replace underscores `_` with spaces ` `, and vice versa.
2. Search for a single less common word. For example, if the library is `LED_Backpack` search for `Backpack` and see if the top few ones work.
3. Ping me, `@WKoA`, on the [Hack Pack discord](https://discord.gg/hackpack).
